The "Hawaii Aloha Network" refers to ALOHAnet, the pioneering packet radio network at the University of Hawaii (1970s) that used random access to share a channel, forming the basis for Ethernet & Wi-Fi. The PDP-11 was a popular Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) minicomputer family (1970s-90s) crucial for many networks, featuring the innovative Unibus for easy peripheral connection, and served as the underlying hardware for ALOHAnet's core nodes, connecting university islands via radio links. So, ALOHAnet was the network protocol/system, and PDP-11s were the powerful computers running it.. 
ALOHAnet (The Network)

    Concept: A random-access network protocol where computers transmit data when ready, repeating after random delays if collisions (overlapping transmissions) occur.
    Pioneering: Developed by Dr. Norman Abramson, it was the first to connect to ARPANET via satellite and is foundational to modern wireless tech (WiFi, Cellular). 

PDP-11 (The Hardware)

    Description: A hugely successful series of 16-bit minicomputers from DEC, known for their common architecture and the flexible Unibus/Qbus for adding devices.
    Role in ALOHAnet: PDP-11s acted as the primary nodes (computers) for the university campuses, processing data and managing the radio communication links with the satellite/other islands, making the concept tangible. 

The Connection

    ALOHAnet used PDP-11s as its workhorses to create the first wireless packet network, demonstrating how small, affordable computers could link together over long distances, laying groundwork for the internet.
