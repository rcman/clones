I want to add user creation and removal with the useradd and rmuser command. When user’s are created it will automatically create a home directory for this user in /home. All users will have a .bashrc file which executes every time they login. This .bashrc can contain alias commands or echo statements. Each user will also have a .bash_history to remember all their commands, they can type the HISTORY command to see this history.  Setup a file passwd file in /etc/ with user home directory and password. The gpio pins need to be monitored for serial connection.  When a terminal is connected a new console session can be establshed via uart serial. Any user account can login via the vt100 terminal.
