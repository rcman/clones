Main Features:

Thread-Safe Filesystem: Added _thread.allocate_lock() to protect concurrent file access
Separate Sessions: Each terminal (USB and UART) gets its own XenixSession instance with independent:

Current directory
Path stack
User login
Terminal state


Shared Resources: All users share the same filesystem, so changes made by one user are visible to others

How It Works:

USB Console: Runs in the main thread on sys.stdin/stdout (labeled ttyUSB0)
UART Terminal: Runs in a separate thread on GPIO pins (labeled ttyS0)
Both can login independently and work simultaneously

Configuration:
Set ENABLE_UART = True/False in main() to enable/disable the UART terminal. Configure UART pins by modifying the _thread.start_new_thread() call:
