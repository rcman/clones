Perfect! I've enhanced your Xenix clone with all the requested features:
New Features Added:
1. Persistent Save State

All filesystem changes are automatically saved to xenix_state.dat when you exit
When you run the program again, it loads your previous session
The entire directory structure, files, and content are preserved

2. MOTD (Message of the Day)

Default MOTD file is created at /etc/motd on first run
Displayed every time you log in
Can be edited using the vi or ed commands:

  vi /etc/motd
3. Text Editors

vi editor: Simple modal editor with insert and command modes

i - Enter insert mode
ESC - Return to command mode
:w - Save file
:q - Quit
:wq - Save and quit
n - Next line, p - Previous line


ed editor: Classic line editor

a - Append text (type . on a line to finish)
p - Print buffer
w - Write to file
q - Quit



4. FAT32 Mount/Unmount

mount: Mount FAT32 filesystems

  mount /path/to/disk.img /mnt
  mount (shows mounted filesystems)

umount: Unmount filesystems

  umount /mnt

Mounted files are imported into the virtual filesystem
Supports reading FAT32 boot sector, directory entries, and file content
Added /mnt directory for mounting

5. Enhanced df Command

Now shows mounted FAT32 filesystems with usage statistics

Usage Examples:
bash# Edit the MOTD
vi /etc/motd

# Mount a FAT32 disk image
mount /path/to/usbdrive.img /mnt

# View mounted filesystems
mount
df

# Unmount
umount /mnt

# Exit and save
exit
The filesystem now uses Java serialization to save/load state, and all changes persist between sessions!
