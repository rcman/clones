So sorry for not fixing this, it's fixed now and will be updated again soon. The File to use for Xenix is PICO_WORKING.py and that's the one you copy to your Pico. The Java version works just fine if you want to use that.<BR>



Upload them to your PICO. If you want to change the pins it's using for Transmit, Receive and Baud Rate change that in the code.

I've added a discussion section to this repo so you can suggest impovements or additions.

Enjoy.
