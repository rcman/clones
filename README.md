# Xenix and VAX Clones running on Raspberry pi PICO

<BR>

So sorry for not fixing this, it's fixed now and will be updated again soon. The File to use for Xenix is PICO_WORKING.py and that's the one you copy to your Pico. <BR>



Upload them to your PICO. If you want to change the pins it's using for Transmit, Receive and Baud Rate change that in the code.

I've added a discussion section to this repo so you can suggest impovements or additions.

Enjoy.
