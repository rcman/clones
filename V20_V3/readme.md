Key points about them:

Drop-in replacements: They were designed to be pin-compatible with Intel's 8088 (V20) and 8086 (V30) processors, meaning you could literally pull out your Intel chip and pop in the NEC equivalent without any other modifications.
Performance boost: They ran about 10-30% faster than the Intel chips they replaced at the same clock speed, thanks to improved microcode and architecture. This made them popular upgrades for IBM PCs and compatibles.
Additional features: They included an 8080 emulation mode, allowing them to run older CP/M software, and had a few extra instructions beyond the standard 8086 instruction set.
Legal battles: Intel sued NEC over these chips, claiming copyright infringement of their microcode. NEC ultimately won the case in 1992, establishing an important precedent that microcode couldn't be copyrighted in the same way as software.
The V30 specifically was the 16-bit data bus version (like the 8086), while the V20 had an 8-bit external data bus (like the 8088).

These chips were quite popular in the late 80s PC clone market as an affordable performance upgrade. Are you working on a retro computing project, or just curious about computer history?
